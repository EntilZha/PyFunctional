## Features
`PyFunctional` makes creating data pipelines easy by using chained functional operators. Here are a
few examples of what it can do:

* Chained operators: `seq(1, 2, 3).map(lambda x: x * 2).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)`
* Expressive and feature complete API
* Read and write `text`, `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`, `sqlite`, `gzip`, `bz2`, and `lzma/xz` files
* Parallelize "embarrassingly parallel" operations like `map` easily
* Complete documentation, rigorous unit test suite, 100% test coverage, and CI which provide
robustness

`PyFunctional`'s API takes inspiration from Scala collections, Apache Spark RDDs, and Microsoft
LINQ.

## Installation
`PyFunctional` is available on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFunctional) and can be
installed by running:

```bash
# Install from command line
$ pip install pyfunctional
```

Then in python run: `from functional import seq`

## Examples
`PyFunctional` is useful for many tasks, and can natively open several common file types. Here
are a few examples of what you can do.

### Simple Example
```python
from functional import seq

seq(1, 2, 3, 4)\
    .map(lambda x: x * 2)\
    .filter(lambda x: x > 4)\
    .reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)
# 14

# or if you don't like backslash continuation
(seq(1, 2, 3, 4)
    .map(lambda x: x * 2)
    .filter(lambda x: x > 4)
    .reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)
)
# 14
```

### Streams, Transformations and Actions
`PyFunctional` has three types of functions:

1. Streams: read data for use by the collections API.
2. Transformations: transform data from streams with functions such as `map`, `flat_map`, and
`filter`
3. Actions: These cause a series of transformations to evaluate to a concrete value. `to_list`,
`reduce`, and `to_dict` are examples of actions.

In the expression `seq(1, 2, 3).map(lambda x: x * 2).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)`, `seq` is the
stream, `map` is the transformation, and `reduce` is the action.

### Filtering a list of account transactions
```python
from functional import seq
from collections import namedtuple

Transaction = namedtuple('Transaction', 'reason amount')
transactions = [
    Transaction('github', 7),
    Transaction('food', 10),
    Transaction('coffee', 5),
    Transaction('digitalocean', 5),
    Transaction('food', 5),
    Transaction('riotgames', 25),
    Transaction('food', 10),
    Transaction('amazon', 200),
    Transaction('paycheck', -1000)
]

# Using the Scala/Spark inspired APIs
food_cost = seq(transactions)\
    .filter(lambda x: x.reason == 'food')\
    .map(lambda x: x.amount).sum()

# Using the LINQ inspired APIs
food_cost = seq(transactions)\
    .where(lambda x: x.reason == 'food')\
    .select(lambda x: x.amount).sum()

# Using PyFunctional with fn
from fn import _
food_cost = seq(transactions).filter(_.reason == 'food').map(_.amount).sum()
```

### Aggregates and Joins
The account transactions example could be done easily in pure python using list comprehensions. To
show some of the things `PyFunctional` excels at, take a look at a couple of word count examples.

```python
words = 'I dont want to believe I want to know'.split(' ')
seq(words).map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduce_by_key(lambda x, y: x + y)
# [('dont', 1), ('I', 2), ('to', 2), ('know', 1), ('want', 2), ('believe', 1)]
```

In the next example we have chat logs formatted in [json lines (jsonl)](http://jsonlines.org/) which
contain messages and metadata. A typical jsonl file will have one valid json on each line of a file.
Below are a few lines out of `examples/chat_logs.jsonl`.

```json
{"message":"hello anyone there?","date":"10/09","user":"bob"}
{"message":"need some help with a program","date":"10/09","user":"bob"}
{"message":"sure thing. What do you need help with?","date":"10/09","user":"dave"}
```

```python
from operator import add
import re
messages = seq.jsonl('examples/chat_logs.jsonl')

# Split words on space and normalize before doing word count
def extract_words(message):
    return re.sub('[^0-9a-z ]+', '', message.lower()).split(' ')


word_counts = messages\
    .map(lambda log: extract_words(log['message']))\
    .flatten().map(lambda word: (word, 1))\
    .reduce_by_key(add).order_by(lambda x: x[1])

```

Next, lets continue that example but introduce a json database of users from `examples/users.json`.
In the previous example we showed how `PyFunctional` can do word counts, in the next example lets
show how `PyFunctional` can join different data sources.

```python
# First read the json file
users = seq.json('examples/users.json')
#[('sarah',{'date_created':'08/08','news_email':True,'email':'sarah@gmail.com'}),...]

email_domains = users.map(lambda u: u[1]['email'].split('@')[1]).distinct()
# ['yahoo.com', 'python.org', 'gmail.com']

# Join users with their messages
message_tuples = messages.group_by(lambda m: m['user'])
data = users.inner_join(message_tuples)
# [('sarah',
#    (
#      {'date_created':'08/08','news_email':True,'email':'sarah@gmail.com'},
#      [{'date':'10/10','message':'what is a...','user':'sarah'}...]
#    )
#  ),...]

# From here you can imagine doing more complex analysis
```

### CSV, Aggregate Functions, and Set functions
In `examples/camping_purchases.csv` there are a list of camping purchases. Lets do some cost
analysis and compare it the required camping gear list stored in `examples/gear_list.txt`.

```python
purchases = seq.csv('examples/camping_purchases.csv')
total_cost = purchases.select(lambda row: int(row[2])).sum()
# 1275

most_expensive_item = purchases.max_by(lambda row: int(row[2]))
# ['4', 'sleeping bag', ' 350']

purchased_list = purchases.select(lambda row: row[1])
gear_list = seq.open('examples/gear_list.txt').map(lambda row: row.strip())
missing_gear = gear_list.difference(purchased_list)
# ['water bottle','gas','toilet paper','lighter','spoons','sleeping pad',...]
```

In addition to the aggregate functions shown above (`sum` and `max_by`) there are many more.
Similarly, there are several more set like functions in addition to `difference`.

### Reading/Writing SQLite3
`PyFunctional` can read and write to SQLite3 database files. In the example below, users are read
 from `examples/users.db` which stores them as rows with columns `id:Int` and `name:String`.

```python
db_path = 'examples/users.db'
users = seq.sqlite3(db_path, 'select * from user').to_list()
# [(1, 'Tom'), (2, 'Jack'), (3, 'Jane'), (4, 'Stephan')]]

sorted_users = seq.sqlite3(db_path, 'select * from user order by name').to_list()
# [(2, 'Jack'), (3, 'Jane'), (4, 'Stephan'), (1, 'Tom')]
```

Writing to a SQLite3 database is similarly easy

```python
import sqlite3
from collections import namedtuple

with sqlite3.connect(':memory:') as conn:
    conn.execute('CREATE TABLE user (id INT, name TEXT)')
    conn.commit()
    User = namedtuple('User', 'id name')
    
    # Write using a specific query
    seq([(1, 'pedro'), (2, 'fritz')]).to_sqlite3(conn, 'INSERT INTO user (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)')
    
    # Write by inserting values positionally from a tuple/list into named table
    seq([(3, 'sam'), (4, 'stan')]).to_sqlite3(conn, 'user')
    
    # Write by inferring schema from namedtuple
    seq([User(name='tom', id=5), User(name='keiga', id=6)]).to_sqlite3(conn, 'user')
    
    # Write by inferring schema from dict
    seq([dict(name='david', id=7), dict(name='jordan', id=8)]).to_sqlite3(conn, 'user')
    
    # Read everything back to make sure it wrote correctly
    print(list(conn.execute('SELECT * FROM user')))
    
    # [(1, 'pedro'), (2, 'fritz'), (3, 'sam'), (4, 'stan'), (5, 'tom'), (6, 'keiga'), (7, 'david'), (8, 'jordan')]
```

## Writing to files
Just as `PyFunctional` can read from `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`, `sqlite3`, and text files, it can
also write them. For complete API documentation see the collections API table or the official docs.

### Compressed Files
`PyFunctional` will auto-detect files compressed with `gzip`, `lzma/xz`, and `bz2`. This is done
by examining the first several bytes of the file to determine if it is compressed so therefore
requires no code changes to work.

To write compressed files, every `to_` function has a parameter `compression` which can be set to
the default `None` for no compression, `gzip` or `gz` for gzip compression, `lzma` or `xz` for lzma
compression, and `bz2` for bz2 compression.

### Parallel Execution
The only change required to enable parallelism is to import `from functional import pseq` instead of
`from functional import seq` and use `pseq` where you would use `seq`. The following
operations are run in parallel with more to be implemented in a future release:

* `map`/`select`
* `filter`/`filter_not`/`where`
* `flat_map`

Parallelization uses python `multiprocessing` and squashes chains of embarrassingly parallel
operations to reduce overhead costs. For example, a sequence of maps and filters would be executed
all at once rather than in multiple loops using `multiprocessing`

## Documentation
Shortform documentation is below and full documentation is at
[docs.pyfunctional.org](docs.pyfunctional.org/en/latest/functional.html).

### Streams API
All of `PyFunctional` streams can be accessed through the `seq` object. The primary way to create
a stream is by calling `seq` with an iterable. The `seq` callable is smart and is able to accept
multiple types of parameters as shown in the examples below.

```python
# Passing a list
seq([1, 1, 2, 3]).to_set()
# [1, 2, 3]

# Passing direct arguments
seq(1, 1, 2, 3).map(lambda x: x).to_list()
# [1, 1, 2, 3]

# Passing a single value
seq(1).map(lambda x: -x).to_list()
# [-1]
```

`seq` also provides entry to other streams as attribute functions as shown below.

```python
# number range
seq.range(10)

# text file
seq.open('filepath')

# json file
seq.json('filepath')

# jsonl file
seq.jsonl('filepath')

# csv file
seq.csv('filepath')
seq.csv_dict_reader('filepath')

# sqlite3 db and sql query
seq.sqlite3('filepath', 'select * from data')
```

For more information on the parameters that these functions can take, reference the
[streams documentation](http://docs.pyfunctional.org/en/latest/functional.html#module-functional.streams)

### Transformations and Actions APIs

### Lazy Execution
Whenever possible, `PyFunctional` will compute lazily. This is accomplished by tracking the list
of transformations that have been applied to the sequence and only evaluating them when an action is
called. In `PyFunctional` this is called tracking lineage. This is also responsible for the
ability for `PyFunctional` to cache results of computation to prevent expensive re-computation.
This is predominantly done to preserve sensible behavior and used sparingly. For example, calling
`size()` will cache the underlying sequence. If this was not done and the input was an iterator,
then further calls would operate on an expired iterator since it was used to compute the length.
Similarly, `repr` also caches since it is most often used during interactive sessions where its
undesirable to keep recomputing the same value. Below are some examples of inspecting lineage.

```python
def times_2(x):
    print(x)
    return 2 * x
elements = seq(1, 1, 2, 3, 4).map(times_2).distinct()
elements._lineage
# Lineage: sequence -> map(times_2) -> distinct

l_elements = elements.to_list()
# Prints: 1
# Prints: 1
# Prints: 2
# Prints: 3
# Prints: 4

elements._lineage
# Lineage: sequence -> map(times_2) -> distinct -> cache

l_elements = elements.to_list()
# The cached result is returned so times_2 is not called and nothing is printed
```

Files are given special treatment if opened through the `seq.open` and related APIs.
`functional.util.ReusableFile` implements a wrapper around the standard python file to support
multiple iteration over a single file object while correctly handling iteration termination and
file closing.

## About me
To learn more about me (the author) visit my webpage at
[pedrorodriguez.io](http://pedrorodriguez.io).

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. My research
interests include large-scale machine learning, distributed computing, and adjacent fields. I
completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2015. I have previously done
research in the UC Berkeley AMPLab with Apache Spark, worked at Trulia as a data scientist,
and worked as a data scientist at Oracle Data Cloud this past summer.

I created `PyFunctional` while using Python extensively at Trulia, and finding that I missed the
ease of use for manipulating data that Spark RDDs and Scala collections have. The project takes the
best ideas from these APIs as well as LINQ to provide an easy way to manipulate data when using
Scala is not an option or PySpark is overkill.
